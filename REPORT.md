## Goals:
1. Reconstruct what visual imagery people were looking at during MRI scans using their functional MRI scan data alone. In other words, to decode the brain activation data and visualize what they were seeing. (similar to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsp1KaM-avU))
2. While doing so, experiment with different proxies than pretrained neural network activations. Almost all papers that attempt a similar task do so by using the same proxy, which is the activations from a pretrained model. In simpler terms, from the brain activations caused by an image, they all predict what a conventional image classifier's activations would be looking at the same image. Then they use the image classifier's activations to reconstruct the image.

## Approach:
Our approach is still evolving, as this project is now part of a course I am taking at Stanford University, CS236: Deep Generative Networks.

## Progress:
I will post updates here as the project unwinds.
